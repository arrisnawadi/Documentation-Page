            Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive,
            object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created
            by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code
            is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This
            tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a
            great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web
            Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of
            learning Python:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Python is Interpreted − </strong>Python is processed at
              runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your
              program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Python is Interactive − </strong>You can actually sit at a
              Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write
              your programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Python is Object-Oriented − </strong>Python supports
              Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that
              encapsulates code within objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Python is a Beginner's Language − </strong>Python is a
              great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the
              development of a wide range of applications from simple text
              processing to WWW browsers to games.
            </li>
          </ul>

            The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java.
            However, there are some definite differences between the languages.
            Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have
            extension .py. Type the following source code in a test.py file −
          </p>
          <code class="codes">print "Hello, Python!"</code>
          <p>
            This produces the following result −
          </p>
          <code class="results">Hello, Python!</code>
        </section>

        <!-- Section -->
        <section class="main-section">
          <!-- Section Title -->
          <header id="Standard_Data_Types">Standard Data Types</header>
          <!-- Section Content -->
          <p>
            The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a
            person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is
            stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data
            types that are used to define the operations possible on them and
            the storage method for each of them.
          </p>
          <p>Python has five standard data types −</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Numbers</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>List</li>
            <li>Tuple</li>
            <li>Dictionary</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Section -->
        <section class="main-section">
          <!-- Section Title -->
          <header id="Numbers">Numbers</header>
          <!-- Section Content -->
          <p>
            Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created
            when you assign a value to them. For example −
          </p>
          <code class="codes"
            >var1 = 1<br />
            var2 = 10</code
          >
          <p>
            You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the
            del statement. The syntax of the del statement is −
          </p>
          <code class="codes">del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]]</code>
          <p>Python supports four different numerical types −</p>
          <ul>
            <li>int (signed integers)</li>
            <li>
              long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and
              hexadecimal)
            </li>
            <li>float (floating point real values)</li>
            <li>complex (complex numbers)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Section -->
        <section class="main-section">
          <!-- Section Title -->
          <header id="Strings">Strings</header>
          <!-- Section Content -->
          <p>
            Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters
            represented in the quotation marks. Python allows for either pairs
            of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using
            the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the
            beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the
            asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example −
          </p>
          <code class="codes"
            >#!/usr/bin/python <br /><br />
            str = 'Hello World!'
            <br /><br />
            print str # Prints complete string<br />
            print str[0] # Prints first character of the string<br />
            print str[2:5] # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th</code
          >
          <p>This will produce the following result −</p>
          <code class="results">
            Hello World!<br />
            H<br />
            llo
          </code>

          <!-- Section Content -->
          <p>
            The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can
            be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between
            square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a
            list need not be of the same type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated
            values between square brackets. For example −
          </p>
          <code class="codes">
            #!/usr/bin/python<br /><br />
            list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];<br />
            list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ];<br />
            print "list1[0]: ", list1[0]<br />
            print "list2[1:5]: ", list2[1:5]
          </code>
          <p>
            When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
          </p>
          <code class="results"
            >list1[0]: physics<br />
            list2[1:5]: [2, 3, 4, 5]</code

          <p>
            A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are
            sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists
            are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use
            parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along
            with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.
            For example −
          </p>
          <code class="codes">
            #!/usr/bin/python<br /><br />
            tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);<br />
            tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 );<br />
            print "tup1[0]: ", tup1[0];<br />
            print "tup2[1:5]: ", tup2[1:5];
          </code>
          <p>
            When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
          </p>
          <code class="results">
            tup1[0]: physics<br />
            tup2[1:5]: [2, 3, 4, 5]

          <p>
            Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are
            separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly
            braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just
            two curly braces, like this: {}.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The
            values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of
            an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square
            brackets along with the key to obtain its value. Following is a
            simple example −
          </p>
          <code class="codes">
            #!/usr/bin/python<br /><br />
            dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}<br />
            print "dict['Name']: ", dict['Name']<br />
            print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age']
          </code>
          <p>
            When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
          </p>
          <code class="results">
            dict['Name']: Zara<br />
            dict['Age']: 7

          <p>
            A Python program can handle date and time in several ways.
            Converting between date formats is a common chore for computers.
            Python's time and calendar modules help track dates and times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time intervals are floating-point numbers in units of seconds.
            Particular instants in time are expressed in seconds since 12:00am,
            January 1, 1970(epoch).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a popular time module available in Python which provides
            functions for working with times, and for converting between
            representations. The function time.time() returns the current system
            time in ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).
          </p>
          <code class="codes">
            #!/usr/bin/python<br />
            import time; # This is required to include time module.<br /><br />
            ticks = time.time()<br />
            print "Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970:", ticks
          </code>
          <p>This would produce a result something as follows −</p>
          <code class="results">
            Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970: 7186862.73399
          </code>
          <p>
            Date arithmetic is easy to do with ticks. However, dates before the
            epoch cannot be represented in this form. Dates in the far future
            also cannot be represented this way - the cutoff point is sometime
            in 2038 for UNIX and Windows.

          <p>
            Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while
            execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to
            the conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE
            or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and
            which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the suite of an if clause consists only of a single line, it may
            go on the same line as the header statement.
          </p>
          <p>Here is an example of a one-line if clause −</p>
          <code class="codes">
            #!/usr/bin/python<br /><br />
            var = 100<br />
            if ( var == 100 ) : print "Value of expression is 100"<br />
            print "Good bye!"
          </code>
          <p>
            When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
          </p>
          <code class="results">
            Value of expression is 100<br />
            Good bye!
